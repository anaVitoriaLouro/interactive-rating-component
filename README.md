## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
This project is part of a challenge to my personal and professional growth.

One of the Objectives was to practice already learned HTML and CSS concepts and, of course, learn new things about it, but the main focus was to initiate my JavaScript apprenticeship and put it to practice.
